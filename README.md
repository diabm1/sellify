# Description

Inspired by the popular web service [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), this project attempts to recreate a similar e-commerce platform with all the functionality of a modern website.

# Usage
 
To use this application, start by navigating to the website here: [Sellify](). From the home page, you can view all of the available products on Sellify. When any of the products are selected, you will be taken to that product's page.

The product page contains all of the relevant information about that product including the name, price, description, and any reviews that other users have left for that product.

Before adding products to your cart, you must login/signup. Find the login/signup button in the navbar at the top. Follow the prompts to sign up, or login using your existing credentials. Once logged in, you can now add products to your cart.

To view all of the products in your cart, find the Cart button at the top of the page. From there, you can view and edit all of the products in your cart.
